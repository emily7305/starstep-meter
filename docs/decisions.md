## madmom install (milestone 1 probe)

Tested in the cloud session: Ubuntu 24.04, Python 3.11.17, numpy 2.4.6, scipy 1.17.1.

- `pip install madmom` (PyPI 0.16.1, from 2018) fails before building: its `setup.py` imports Cython but doesn't declare it as a build dependency, so pip's isolated build env has no Cython.
- Installing `numpy` and `Cython` first and then `pip install --no-build-isolation madmom` builds, but `import madmom` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'` (current setuptools no longer ships it). 0.16.1 also uses numpy aliases that were removed in numpy 1.24, so I stopped there.
- `pip install git+https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom` works: it builds 0.17.dev0 and `scripts/check_madmom.py` runs `DBNDownBeatTrackingProcessor` on a generated 120 BPM click track, finds 23 beats with the right downbeats and a median tempo of 120.00.

So the `madmom` extra in `pyproject.toml` pins that git commit (`27f032e8947204902c675e5e341a3faf5dc86dae`), installed with `pip install -e .[madmom]`. That was checked in a clean venv too.

Not tested yet: Windows. madmom has Cython extensions, so a source build on Windows needs the MSVC Build Tools (the "Desktop development with C++" workload). Python 3.12/3.13 weren't tried either.

One number for milestone 2: on the click track, madmom's beats come out 10 ms before the click onsets (490 ms for a click at 500 ms). It runs at 100 frames per second, so 10 ms is one frame. Onset snapping will have to deal with that.

Nothing in milestone 1 imports madmom. `/api/health` only checks whether it's importable, and the librosa path runs without it.
